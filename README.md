Hello World!!

### W2
1. The r, g, and b values will vary between 0.0 and 1.0, which means they are a fractional value. Therefore, floats should be sued since they store floating point variables
2. _bounce can be an integer variable, beause there will never be a fraction or a bounce, and you don't have to store words or booleans to track the number of bounces.
3. The mistake in step 4 was that the swmi-colo was missing.


### W3
The way setLightDimness wold be coded would depend on what the variables mean. You should get the sanity level as an integer and set the make the room brighter when the payer is more sane and darker as the plater spirals depending on what 0 and 100% sanity means for the game. since you're only changing a parameter, no output is needed so the output type would be void.

Metaphor for classes and components were skinwalkers. the skinwalker is the component and the skin is the class, since differnet classes have diffenret methods which change the behavior.

### W4
private bool _isGrounded = true; creates a private boolean variable named _isGrounded, which is initialzied to true, and may be changed later.

if (Input.GetKeyDown(KeyCode.Space) && _isGrounded) checks if both the space bar is pressed and if the _isGroudned variable is true. It will process as True only if both conditions are true, otherwise it will be false.

_isGrounded = false; sets the _isGrounded avariable to false.
